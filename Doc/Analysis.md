### 🔍 Bar Chart Interpretation

The bar chart presents the **total trading volume per year** for Google stocks from 2004 to 2024. It uses colored bars to differentiate each year, which helps visualize the trend clearly.

#### Key Findings:

* **2004-2008**: A massive surge in trading volume, especially during Google’s IPO and the early growth phase. This suggests high investor interest and activity in the company's initial years.
* **2009-2014**: A plateau in trading volume, indicating market stabilization and possibly less speculative trading.
* **2015-2020**: A moderate increase resumes, reflecting growing confidence and expansion in tech investments.
* **2021-2024**: A sharp rise again, potentially due to increased retail investor participation during the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic tech boom.

### 🔍 Scatter Plot Interpretation

The scatter plot visualizes the same data (total yearly volume), but with individual dots per year, making the volatility and distribution more evident.

#### Observations:

* **Early peaks** (2004-2008) are still prominent, confirming the findings in the bar chart.
* **Outliers** like **2020 and 2023** stand out with notably higher volumes, hinting at market shocks or investor surges.
* **Low points** in years like 2013 and 2016 may correspond with calmer economic periods or shifts in investment strategies.

### 📌 Summary

The visualizations indicate that Google’s trading activity experienced an initial boom, followed by stabilization, and a renewed surge in the 2020s. These trends likely reflect broader market dynamics, including economic cycles, technological innovation, and global events like the pandemic.

The combination of bar and scatter charts offers a holistic view—making it easier to detect both long-term patterns and individual anomalies in trading behavior.
